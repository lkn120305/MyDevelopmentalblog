    <h3>Introduction to HTML, CSS & JS</h3>
      <p>In this week’s lesson, I learned about the programming languages used to develop the front-end of a website, which are HTML, CSS & Javascript. HTML is used to create the structure and content of a website. CSS is used to design a website. Javascript is used to add functionalities to a website.</p>
  
  <p>Besides that, I also learned about the HTML elements used to create the structure of a website. Here are the following elements I learnt:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>head</strong> → contains meta information for the document</li>
    <li><strong>body</strong> → contains the content of the page</li>
    <li><strong>h1 - h6</strong> → header element</li>
    <li><strong>p</strong> → paragraph element</li>
    <li><strong>b</strong> → bold element</li>
    <li><strong>strong</strong> → bold the text</li>
    <li><strong>ul</strong> → create an unordered list</li>
    <li><strong>ol</strong> → create an ordered list</li>
    <li><strong>li</strong> → define each list element</li>
    <li><strong>em</strong> → emphasis on the text (italic)</li>
    <li><strong>title</strong> → defines the title of the document</li>
    <li><strong>a</strong> → anchor/hyperlink element</li>
    <li><strong>img</strong> → use to display an image</li>
    <li><strong>div</strong> → define a section of document (block)</li>
    <li><strong>span</strong> → define a section of document (inline)</li>
    <li><strong>table</strong> → table element</li>
    <li><strong>tr</strong> → table row</li>
    <li><strong>th</strong> → table header</li>
    <li><strong>td</strong> → table data</li>
    <li><strong>iframe</strong> → used to embed another doc within current HTML doc</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Semantics - CSS</h3>
	  <p>In this week’s lesson, I learned about HTML semantics and a bit of CSS styling.</p>

    <p>During the lessons, I learned and understood that the <strong>div</strong> element is a generic container that is used to group elements for styling &amp; other such purposes. It is important to utilize HTML semantics to improve the structure of our code and make it more readable and maintainable. Additionally, implementing proper semantics enhances the accessibility of a web page for users with visual impairments as screen readers rely on these to interpret the HTML code more accurately.</p>

    <p>Some of the common HTML semantics elements are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>header</strong> → used for navigation or introductory content</li>
      <li><strong>nav</strong> → used to hold menu links</li>
      <li><strong>article</strong> → used for news content, blog posts or independent content piece</li>
      <li><strong>section</strong> → defines a section in a document</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As for CSS, I understood how it can be used to modify the colour, size, and position of specific elements on a webpage. I discovered that web developers can use attributes such as element IDs and classes to select and style particular elements. Additionally, I learned about the concept of <strong>pseudo-classes</strong>, which allow developers to modify the style of an element based on various user interactions, like hovering or clicking.</p>

    <p>In addition, I explored how CSS can be used to style other properties of elements, such as typography, margins, and padding. Specifically, I learned how to change the font family, size, weight, and text style on a webpage using CSS. I also discovered that external font libraries, such as those provided by Google, can be utilized to add custom typography to a website.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, I learned how to adjust the margin and padding values of specific elements on a webpage. These values can be set using specific units such as pixels or percentages, or by using relative units such as ems or rems. Additionally, CSS provides shorthand properties that allow set margin and padding values to be set for all sides at once or for each side separately.</p>

    <h3>Forms & Advanced CSS Layouts</h3>
    <p>In this week’s lesson, I learned about <strong>HTML forms, selectors & grouping, media queries, positioning, flexbox, and wireframes.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>HTML forms</strong> enable users to input data which can be sent to a database server for processing. Typically, a form comprises multiple input elements such as text fields, date fields, colour fields, file insertion, checkboxes, and radio buttons. To describe the purpose of each input element, labels can be added in front of them. HTML provides form validation attributes like 'required' to validate input values. If necessary, you can use JavaScript to define custom validation rules for your form.</p>
    <p><strong>Descendant selectors</strong> in CSS are used to select elements that are descendants of another element, basically elements within an element. The selector targets elements that are nested inside the parent element. It is denoted by a space between the parent element and the child element. Developers can go as many levels as they want with descendant selectors, but it’s best to stop at 3 levels. CSS also allows developers to group multiple selectors to allow the styling of multiple elements at once. I also learned about the "<strong>!important</strong>" function that allows a specific element to take precedence over every other element.</p>
    <p><strong>Media Queries</strong> are used in CSS to allow web developers to style a webpage differently based on the screen size of a device. CSS styling conditions can be specified based on the maximum and minimum screen widths of a device.</p>
    <p><strong>CSS positioning</strong> can be used in 4 different ways, relative, absolute, fixed & z-index. Relative positioning is used to position items relative to their original position. Absolute Positioning is used to position an element on a webpage relative to its parent element or body of the page. Fixed positioning is used to position an object in such a way that it stays in the same place even if the user scrolls. Z-index is used to control the stacking order of elements. An element with a higher z-index value will appear on top of elements with a lower value.</p>
    <p><strong>Flexbox</strong> is a container used to adjust the alignment, direction, and order of elements. The items kept inside a flexbox are called flex items. These flex items can be laid out both horizontally and vertically. They can adapt their layout to suit the content.</p>
    <p><strong>Wireframes</strong> are like blueprint layouts for websites & apps. They are used to show how important functionalities on a website would look like.</p>

    <h3>Responsive Images & Git</h3>
    <p>In this week’s lesson, I learned about <strong>responsive images</strong> and <strong>Git</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Responsive images</strong> can be implemented on a web page using 2 methods. The first method involves setting a maximum size for the image, which will scale it down to fit within that size while preserving its aspect ratio. The second method involves using <code>srcset</code>. This methods allows you to provide multiple versions of an image at different resolutions, and the browser will automatically choose the best one to display based on the screen size and pixel density of the device.</p>
    <p>Another technique for fitting an image inside a container is to use the CSS property "<strong>background-size: cover</strong>." This property will scale the image up or down as necessary to completely cover the container while maintaining the image's aspect ratio. This can be particularly useful when you want to display a background image that fills the entire viewport of the browser window.</p>
    <p><strong>Git</strong> is a version control system that allows you to manage different versions of a project. It enables you to reset file contents to a previous version and keep track of the history of changes and why they were made.</p>

    <h3>Javascript Basics</h3>
    <p>In this week’s lesson, I got to experience <strong>JavaScript</strong> for the first time. I learned about <strong>objects</strong>, <strong>classes</strong>, <strong>functions</strong>, and <strong>methods</strong>.</p>
    <p>Objects are created from classes and can store both values and functions. To define a class, you can use a function to assign values to properties using the "this" keyword. For example, you might create a class called "Car" like this:</p>
    <pre><code>function Car(model, colour) {
  this.model = model;
  this.colour = colour;
}</code></pre>
    <p>A method is a function that belongs to a class or object. For instance, you might create a regular function like this:</p>
    <pre><code>function Test() {
  // Place your code here
}</code></pre>
    <p>Object functions, on the other hand, are defined as properties within an object and can be called using dot notation. For example, you might define an object method like this:</p>
    <pre><code>Car: function() {
  return "Model: " + this.model;
}</code></pre>
    <p>By using objects and classes, you can write more organized and efficient code that is easier to read and maintain. Methods allow you to perform specific tasks within the context of an object or class, while properties store information that can be used by those methods. Overall, understanding how to use functions and methods is essential for creating effective and well-structured code.</p>

    <h3>Javascript Basics & DOM</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>In this week's lesson</strong>, it was more of a development on last week's content and an introduction to DOM trees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, I learned about the various data types in JavaScript, which are similar to those in other programming languages. There are three types: <strong>boolean</strong>, <strong>number</strong>, and <strong>string</strong>. I also learned that JavaScript has dynamic typing, which means that you can add a named variable to a string of text. Additionally, I learned about template literals, which allow you to incorporate defined variables in JS code. For example, you can write something like: <code><pre>var age = 35;</pre> console.log('My age is ${y}')</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, I learned about different types of comparison and logical operators. Most of the operators seemed to be familiar as they seemed to be similar to operators used in C-family programming languages. The only 2 operators that seemed to be unique and new to me were the <strong>strict equal operator</strong> and <strong>regular equal operator</strong> which are denoted by "<code>===</code>" and "<code>==</code>" respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, I learned about the <strong>for loop</strong>, <strong>while loop</strong>, and <strong>for-of loop</strong>. I was familiar with the for and while loops as I have used them before in python and C#. The for-of loop seemed new initially but after I understood how it was being used, it felt very similar to the foreach loop used in C#.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, I learned about the <strong>DOM tree</strong>, which represents the structure of HTML elements on a web page. Then, I went on to learn how to select elements within the DOM tree using functions like <code>getElementById()</code>, <code>querySelector()</code>, <code>getElementsByClassName()</code>, <code>getElementsByTagName()</code>, and <code>querySelectorAll()</code>. I also got to learn how to access the class names, <strong>innerHTML</strong> and <strong>textContent</strong> properties of selected elements.
