    <h3>Introduction to HTML, CSS & JS</h3>
      <p>In this week’s lesson, I learned about the programming languages used to develop the front-end of a website, which are HTML, CSS & Javascript. HTML is used to create the structure and content of a website. CSS is used to design a website. Javascript is used to add functionalities to a website.</p>
  
  <p>Besides that, I also learned about the HTML elements used to create the structure of a website. Here are the following elements I learnt:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>head</strong> → contains meta information for the document</li>
    <li><strong>body</strong> → contains the content of the page</li>
    <li><strong>h1 - h6</strong> → header element</li>
    <li><strong>p</strong> → paragraph element</li>
    <li><strong>b</strong> → bold element</li>
    <li><strong>strong</strong> → bold the text</li>
    <li><strong>ul</strong> → create an unordered list</li>
    <li><strong>ol</strong> → create an ordered list</li>
    <li><strong>li</strong> → define each list element</li>
    <li><strong>em</strong> → emphasis on the text (italic)</li>
    <li><strong>title</strong> → defines the title of the document</li>
    <li><strong>a</strong> → anchor/hyperlink element</li>
    <li><strong>img</strong> → use to display an image</li>
    <li><strong>div</strong> → define a section of document (block)</li>
    <li><strong>span</strong> → define a section of document (inline)</li>
    <li><strong>table</strong> → table element</li>
    <li><strong>tr</strong> → table row</li>
    <li><strong>th</strong> → table header</li>
    <li><strong>td</strong> → table data</li>
    <li><strong>iframe</strong> → used to embed another doc within current HTML doc</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

    <h3>Semantics - CSS</h3>
	  <p>In this week’s lesson, I learned about HTML semantics and a bit of CSS styling.</p>

    <p>During the lessons, I learned and understood that the <strong>div</strong> element is a generic container that is used to group elements for styling &amp; other such purposes. It is important to utilize HTML semantics to improve the structure of our code and make it more readable and maintainable. Additionally, implementing proper semantics enhances the accessibility of a web page for users with visual impairments as screen readers rely on these to interpret the HTML code more accurately.</p>

    <p>Some of the common HTML semantics elements are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>header</strong> → used for navigation or introductory content</li>
      <li><strong>nav</strong> → used to hold menu links</li>
      <li><strong>article</strong> → used for news content, blog posts or independent content piece</li>
      <li><strong>section</strong> → defines a section in a document</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As for CSS, I understood how it can be used to modify the colour, size, and position of specific elements on a webpage. I discovered that web developers can use attributes such as element IDs and classes to select and style particular elements. Additionally, I learned about the concept of <strong>pseudo-classes</strong>, which allow developers to modify the style of an element based on various user interactions, like hovering or clicking.</p>

    <p>In addition, I explored how CSS can be used to style other properties of elements, such as typography, margins, and padding. Specifically, I learned how to change the font family, size, weight, and text style on a webpage using CSS. I also discovered that external font libraries, such as those provided by Google, can be utilized to add custom typography to a website.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, I learned how to adjust the margin and padding values of specific elements on a webpage. These values can be set using specific units such as pixels or percentages, or by using relative units such as ems or rems. Additionally, CSS provides shorthand properties that allow set margin and padding values to be set for all sides at once or for each side separately.</p>

    <h3>Forms & Advanced CSS Layouts</h3>
    <p>In this week’s lesson, I learned about <strong>HTML forms, selectors & grouping, media queries, positioning, flexbox, and wireframes.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>HTML forms</strong> enable users to input data which can be sent to a database server for processing. Typically, a form comprises multiple input elements such as text fields, date fields, colour fields, file insertion, checkboxes, and radio buttons. To describe the purpose of each input element, labels can be added in front of them. HTML provides form validation attributes like 'required' to validate input values. If necessary, you can use JavaScript to define custom validation rules for your form.</p>
    <p><strong>Descendant selectors</strong> in CSS are used to select elements that are descendants of another element, basically elements within an element. The selector targets elements that are nested inside the parent element. It is denoted by a space between the parent element and the child element. Developers can go as many levels as they want with descendant selectors, but it’s best to stop at 3 levels. CSS also allows developers to group multiple selectors to allow the styling of multiple elements at once. I also learned about the "<strong>!important</strong>" function that allows a specific element to take precedence over every other element.</p>
    <p><strong>Media Queries</strong> are used in CSS to allow web developers to style a webpage differently based on the screen size of a device. CSS styling conditions can be specified based on the maximum and minimum screen widths of a device.</p>
    <p><strong>CSS positioning</strong> can be used in 4 different ways, relative, absolute, fixed & z-index. Relative positioning is used to position items relative to their original position. Absolute Positioning is used to position an element on a webpage relative to its parent element or body of the page. Fixed positioning is used to position an object in such a way that it stays in the same place even if the user scrolls. Z-index is used to control the stacking order of elements. An element with a higher z-index value will appear on top of elements with a lower value.</p>
    <p><strong>Flexbox</strong> is a container used to adjust the alignment, direction, and order of elements. The items kept inside a flexbox are called flex items. These flex items can be laid out both horizontally and vertically. They can adapt their layout to suit the content.</p>
    <p><strong>Wireframes</strong> are like blueprint layouts for websites & apps. They are used to show how important functionalities on a website would look like.</p>
